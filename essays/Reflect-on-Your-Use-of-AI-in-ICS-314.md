## Introduction

*Artificial intelligence will have a more profound impact on humanity than fire, electricity and the internet. - Sundar Pichai*

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly evolving technology that has become increasingly integrated into modern society. Although its widespread use is relatively recent, it is already transforming many aspects of daily life, especially in the field of education. According to Campus Technology, 86% of college students use AI to support their academic work. AI has proven particularly valuable in computer science and software engineering, where it excels at answering coding questions and generating code snippets. This has led many software engineers to adopt AI tools to streamline their workflow, allowing them to avoid spending time writing routine or repetitive code.

As a computer science student currently taking the software engineering course ICS 314, I have found AI tools to be especially helpful. I primarily use ChatGPT to write and troubleshoot code. While I also use it in other classes for studying, its benefits are most pronounced in computer science-related subjects. Another AI tool worth mentioning is GitHub Copilot, which provides real-time code suggestions and error fixes directly within the IDE, such as Visual Studio Code. Although it may not always be as advanced as ChatGPT in understanding broader context, Copilot has the advantage of being integrated into the development environment, allowing it to understand the structure of the entire codebase. 

## Personal Experience with AI

1 Experience WODs

The first experience WOD that comes to mind is definitely the digits WODs. I used ChatGPT for most of the experience WODs since it helped me save a lot of time but not for the digits WODs. The main reason I didn't use ChatGPT for those is that it doesn't help as much compared to other WODs, since you have to edit multiple page.tsx files depending on your needs. It would take too much time to go back and forth, and there's a possibility that ChatGPT wouldn't understand how my components work unless I provide all the files in the template.

2 In-class Practice WODs

We did multiple practice WODs in class, and I attended all of them. I don’t recall completing any of the practice WODs without using ChatGPT, since they were just for practice and I wanted to see if using it would actually help with that week’s WODs. In some cases, I even tried copying and pasting the entire question and asking for the answer to gauge how much more I needed to practice before the real WOD. Overall, I would say that for practice WODs, using ChatGPT was definitely effective and saved me time and effort.

3 In-class WODs

We also did multiple actual WODs in class, and I attended all of them except for the last one. Just like with the practice WODs, I used ChatGPT in almost all of the actual WODs, since I had already concluded that using it was helpful during the practice sessions. However, some of the actual WODs were more difficult than the practice ones, so I had to use ChatGPT more strategically to get the answers I needed by asking it multiple times. In the end, it helped me avoid failing any of the actual WODs except for the last one, where it seemed like ChatGPT wouldn’t be as helpful due to the same issues as in the digits WOD.

4 Essays

We wrote a lot of essays in the early part of the semester but stopped around the middle, and recently started writing them again. I used ChatGPT only to check my grammar for all of my essays, except for one where I also used it to brainstorm, since the topic was a bit complicated. That essay was about design patterns, and I struggled with it because it was something I had never learned before. ChatGPT did an excellent job checking grammar, and I’m using it for this essay as well, but I’m not planning to use it to write the essay for me, since that wouldn’t reflect my own ideas and voice.

5 Final project

I would say that using AI was almost essential for most students in ICS 314 to complete the final project. I assume that no one would have been able to finish the project without AI, because there were so many small issues and details that we weren’t taught in class. For example, I spent more than six hours just trying to solve database problems, and ChatGPT helped me a lot in figuring them out. For the coding part of the final project, I decided to use ChatGPT even though it was somewhat similar to the digits WOD because there was no time limit, and it turned out to be more helpful than I expected as long as you provide enough detail.

6 Learning a concept / tutorial

I believe that using AI to learn concepts and go through tutorials is actually the best way to use it. It basically saves you the time of googling and explains things clearly like having a personal online tutor who is available anytime. We encountered so many new topics in this class, and the available tutorials were often not very helpful, with some even being outdated. ChatGPT helped me a lot in working through tutorials and learning how to use tools like the Postgres database system.

7 Answering a question in class or in Discord

This is another example of how I believe AI should be used. If you have a question, it’s usually better to ask AI than to rely on Google these days, because there’s a higher chance of finding incorrect or outdated answers through a regular search. It’s often better to trust AI to find the right answer, especially since it’s more knowledgeable in areas you may not understand well. I was able to solve many questions just by asking ChatGPT, but there were definitely some issues like the pooling problem with Supabase and Vercel that should have been addressed by the instructors, since AI couldn’t resolve them.

8 Asking or answering a smart-question

Answering questions is basically the same as what I mentioned above, so I will talk about using AI to ask questions. Sometimes, when you don’t have enough knowledge about a topic, you can use AI to help you phrase better questions for others to answer. Personally, I never used AI for this purpose because I felt it was always better to just ask AI directly. However, it’s definitely worth trying if you’re planning to post a question on Stack Overflow.

9 Coding example

ChatGPT is also very good at providing examples for complex problems. I always use it to ask for simpler examples and clear explanations whenever I come across difficult code that I don’t understand. I think it’s much easier to ask ChatGPT to generate examples than to search for them on Google. I was able to learn much more thanks to how accurately ChatGPT provides example code, especially when I was learning new languages like JavaScript and TypeScript.

10 Explaining code

This is similar to the example above, but ChatGPT is also amazing at explaining code. Sometimes it explains things in a way that’s more suited for advanced users, but you can just ask it to explain more simply. It’s like having a personal teacher who will answer as many questions as you want and explain things as many times as you need. I always use it to ask how a specific line of code works when I don’t understand it; especially in Next.js sample templates, where there were many lines of code I had never learned before.

11 Writing code

ChatGPT is usually excellent at writing code, but the results really depend on the user. I can say that it will definitely give wrong answers if the question is poorly asked. For example, even though it wasn’t easy, I used ChatGPT to write code for my final project, despite the issues I mentioned earlier with the digits WOD. But I had to ask it multiple times and provide a lot of detailed information to get it to generate the correct code.

12 Documenting code

I think this is similar to explaining code, since documenting code is basically the same as writing comments, just across multiple lines. I personally didn’t need to document code, so I’m not entirely sure how AI can be used for that, but I believe it would do an excellent job as usual. Comments are generally meant to help others read and understand the code, and since ChatGPT is good at explaining, it should handle that well too. As long as ChatGPT understands how a line of code works, it should be useful for generating comments.

13 Quality assurance

ChatGPT is pretty good at fixing errors in lines of code. However, when the code involves multiple files like in the digits WOD or the final project, it can sometimes get confused. Still, I think using it is much faster than searching on Google, so it's better to provide as much detail as possible about your problem. I personally used it every time I encountered an error while working on final project, and now I know how to use it effectively to fix most issues.

14 Other uses in ICS 314 not listed

I would say that I used ChatGPT the most this semester for ICS 311. I don’t like reading the textbook, and the lecture notes-which are just summaries of the textbook-don’t contain enough detailed explanations, so it’s hard to understand the material by reading them alone. Instead, I asked ChatGPT to explain the lecture notes in more detail, and it did an excellent job, as expected. I saved a lot of time by not reading the textbook and using ChatGPT to learn the material before class.
