summary: "I created a bank database application program for ICS 212, written in both C and C++."
---

This is a bank database application program designed to function as a database system for a bank. The program is available in both C and C++ versions, allowing users to choose the version that best suits their needs. I created the C version first and then converted the code to C++, as the two languages are very similar. I added more detail and functionality with functions in the C++ version compared to the C version. I can confidently state that this program has minimal errors, as I tested it with most of the rare inputs that users might enter. 

I worked on this project independently, dedicating over 100 hours to completing both versions of the program. The coding was done using vi on a school Unix server. This program includes four main functions: adding a record, printing all records, finding a record, and deleting a record. The program reads from a file when you first run it, creating one if the file does not exist. When you exit the program, it automatically writes the data to the file, ensuring that changes are saved.

I learned how to create a database program that can be integrated with a User Interface (UI). A database program does not need to focus on aesthetics, as that is the responsibility of the UI. Due to the length of the code, I spent several hours debugging to identify and prevent errors that could arise from user interactions. I realized that designing the program is actually more important than writing the code itself. Effective design can save a significant amount of time when you have the right structure in place.
