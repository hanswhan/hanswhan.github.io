## The Role of Questions in Learning

*Without questions, there is no learning. - W. Edwards Deming*

I believe that all learning comes from asking questions, as no one can understand everything without any doubts. Asking questions is an essential part of the learning process, and it is important to ask the right questions that clarify your confusion. For software engineers, knowing how to ask smart questions in the community is a valuable skill. It allows them to better understand their problems and fosters collaboration with others. Additionally, other people who have the same question can learn from your post, which ultimately facilitates learning for everyone. However, the quality of the answer you receive often depends on how you ask the question, which could either solve your problem or leave it unresolved.

## Crafting Effective Questions for Better Answers

If you ask a question in a smart way, you are more likely to receive a high-quality answer from others. People are generally willing to spend their time helping you and discussing your problem only if you ask the question properly. For example, one user on Stack Overflow asked a question in a smart way, which led to the post being viewed by about 2.1 million people and receiving more than 6,000 upvotes. The question attracted 44 answers, and the top answer was actually much longer than the question itself, providing a detailed explanation of the solution. The key to the question's success was that the author clearly stated the problem at the beginning, then explained what they had tried and the results of each attempt. The author also included lines of code, not as an image but as text, making it easy for readers to copy and paste.

## Pitfalls of Poorly Asked Questions

However, if you ask a question in a not smart way, there is a high chance that your post will be ignored without any answers. If your post is lucky enough to be seen by kind people, they might politely point out what is wrong with it or they might make fun of you as a joke. For example, another user on Stack Overflow asked a question in a poor way, and it was viewed only 70 times while receiving 7 downvotes. This user was actually fortunate because there was one answer and several comments explaining what they had done wrong in their post. The main issue was that the user was asking what was wrong with their code for a LeetCode problem but had simply copy-pasted ChatGPT's response about their code into the post. Additionally, the user used phrases like "just putting this out for thoughts," which suggested that they were not genuinely seeking concrete feedback or were not serious about resolving their issue.

## Key Takeaways on Asking Smart Questions

In conclusion, I realized that the depth and clarity of the response you get depend on how much effort you put into asking your question. There are millions of questions on Stack Overflow, and some of them have excellent answers, so it’s important to search for existing solutions before asking the same question and wasting other people’s time. While it’s true that many questions remain unanswered due to the sheer volume of posts submitted every day, a significant number go unanswered because they are not asked in the right way. It’s essential to acknowledge that even asking a question in a smart way does not guarantee an answer, as responses are provided by volunteers. Moreover, understanding that people on Stack Overflow are willing to help without compensation highlights the importance of respecting them by clearly explaining your problem. Just as your time is valuable, other people's time is valuable too.
