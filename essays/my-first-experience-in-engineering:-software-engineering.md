## Embracing New Challenges

*Life is either a daring adventure or nothing - Helen Keller* 

Doing something you've never tried before can be challenging. This is exactly the situation I'm in right now—this is my first time taking an engineering class in my life. What makes it even more difficult is that the class focuses on software. I didn’t want to take any engineering classes but still wanted to pursue a STEM major, which is why I chose Computer Science. And yet, here I am, about to tackle this intimidating class that will challenge me throughout the semester!

## Facing Fears with Excitement

Yes, it’s true that I’m afraid, but I’m also excited because I feel like software engineers are awesome. They have the ability to create any kind of software they want and earn a good salary for their hard work. I also want to find out if I like software engineering since I’ve never tried it before. Depending on my performance—of course, I want to at least pass this class—I can decide which ICS elective classes to take next semester. I’m willing to give my best effort in this class to learn more about myself as a Computer Science major.

## Building Foundations for the Future

If I realize that I enjoy software engineering and want to learn more about it, then I want to gain as many skills and experiences as possible from this class. This is an introductory class for software engineering, which means having a strong foundation will help me perform better in future classes. One skill I definitely want to develop is problem-solving because I often tend to get stuck on a problem and waste a lot of time trying to solve it. Another experience I hope to gain is working on projects, as I have never done any professional coding projects before. Ultimately, I hope this class will help me decide whether software engineering is something I want to pursue in the future.
