## The Transformative Power of AI in Software Engineering Education

*Artificial intelligence will have a more profound impact on humanity than fire, electricity and the internet. - Sundar Pichai*

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly evolving technology that has become increasingly integrated into modern society. Although its widespread use is relatively recent, it is already transforming many aspects of daily life, especially in the field of education. According to Campus Technology, 86% of college students use AI to support their academic work. AI has proven particularly valuable in computer science and software engineering, where it excels at answering coding questions and generating code snippets. This has led many software engineers to adopt AI tools to streamline their workflow, allowing them to avoid spending time writing routine or repetitive code.

As a computer science student currently taking the software engineering course ICS 314, I have found AI tools to be especially helpful. I primarily use ChatGPT to write and troubleshoot code. While I also use it in other classes for studying, its benefits are most pronounced in computer science-related subjects. Another AI tool worth mentioning is GitHub Copilot, which provides real-time code suggestions and error fixes directly within the IDE, such as Visual Studio Code. Although it may not always be as advanced as ChatGPT in understanding broader context, Copilot has the advantage of being integrated into the development environment, allowing it to understand the structure of the entire codebase.
