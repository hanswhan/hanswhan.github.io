## The Importance of Coding Standards

*Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand - Martin Fowler*

There are many ways to write the same code, whether by using different methods or simply formatting it differently, such as placing statements on new lines. However, as long as the code functions correctly, the computer will have no issues processing it. The challenge arises when multiple programmers work together on a project with their own coding preferences, which can lead to confusion and inconsistency, making collaboration difficult. To address this, coding standards have been established to create a uniform style that enhances readability and maintainability for all team members. While adhering to coding standards may seem tedious at first, as it requires adjusting one’s habitual coding style and paying close attention to formatting, it ultimately improves code clarity and consistency.

## My Experience with Coding Standards

During my ICS 212 course last semester with Professor Ravi Narayan, coding standards were strictly enforced. There were three key rules to follow: include header comments for each file and function, use only one return statement per function, and always place brackets on a new line. As a self-proclaimed lazy programmer, I initially found these rules frustrating. The restriction on multiple return statements, in particular, was difficult for me since I was accustomed to exiting functions using return conditions, so I had to find alternative ways to structure my code. However, over time, I realized that this rule improved code readability by making it easier to determine what a function returns. 

## Discovering the Benefits of ESLint

Currently, in my ICS 314 course, I have been introduced to ESLint for the first time, and I already appreciate its value. This tool automatically enforces coding standards, ensuring that my code adheres to best practices. It even provides commands to fix formatting issues, which is incredibly convenient. While some programmers might find ESLint frustrating, especially if they view coding standards as unnecessary, I now recognize their importance and try to maintain a positive outlook. ESLint streamlines the process, making it easier to write clean and consistent code without manually checking every line.

## Final Thoughts

For software engineers, collaboration is inevitable, and adhering to coding standards is essential for maintaining a cohesive codebase. Manually following coding standards can be tedious, but tools like ESLint help alleviate much of the burden, particularly for programmers who prioritize efficiency. These tools not only catch errors early but also enforce best practices, ensuring consistency across the team. Ultimately, the effort invested in writing well-structured code benefits both the individual and the team. Clear, standardized code is easier to read, debug, and maintain, making it a worthwhile practice to embrace.
