## TypeScript: A Challenge for the Lazy

*I choose a lazy person to do a hard job. Because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it - Bill Gates*

However, TypeScript is not a friendly language for lazy people like me. It requires explicit type annotations along with a complex setup and configuration. Compared to how simple Python is, TypeScript feels too complicated and annoying. Additionally, every time I learn a new language, I always get confused with others, as some aspects are similar while others are not. It is important to learn new things and understand them well, especially since things in computer science change so quickly nowadays.

## First Steps into TypeScript

I have never tried coding in TypeScript before and this will be my first time. However, I have heard about it because it is closely related to JavaScript, which is one of the most widely used programming languages today. I learned that JavaScript code works in TypeScript without any issues, and it can also work the other way around after conversion. I think TypeScript is a good programming language for long projects that require a lot of work. On the other hand, it might be better to use another language for simple projects that can be done alone.

## The Struggles of Quizzes and WODs

I personally don't like taking quizzes often because they are too stressful. I understand that the intention is to encourage you to keep up with the material and continuously spend time on the subject. However, I often feel overwhelmed, as Iâ€™m not very good at managing my time and tend to do a lot of work all at once on certain days. Practice WODs are definitely helpful since they prepare you for the actual WODs in class. Still, I believe having a WOD every week is a bit too much because it requires you to be fully prepared for every class.
